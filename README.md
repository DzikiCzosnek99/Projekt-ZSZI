# Projekt-ZSZI
Project assignment using a database hosted on the AGH server. Access is available via VPN or by direct connection to the AGH network. The aim of the project was to create a simple website that individually generates a ranking of the 10 best apartment offers for each user. The ranking is based on a previously created database of apartments for sale and the user's preferences, who selects the weights of the criteria for potential apartments.
